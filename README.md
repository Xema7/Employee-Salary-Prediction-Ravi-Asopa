Employee Salary Prediction Web App
This project is a machine learning application that predicts employee salaries based on various professional factors. The project includes a data analysis and model training pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook and a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for interactive predictions and data exploration.

üöÄ Features
Salary Prediction: Predicts employee salaries in USD based on experience level, employment type, job title, company location, and company size.

Currency Conversion: Converts the predicted USD salary to other currencies using real-time exchange rates.

Interactive Visualizations: Explore salary data through various charts and plots.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.

üìä Dataset
The project uses the salary.csv dataset, which contains information about salaries for various tech roles. The key features used for prediction are:

experience_level

employment_type

job_title

company_location

company_size

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Cleaning: The initial dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and format inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Categorical features were encoded into numerical values suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training: Several regression models were trained and evaluated, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Model Selection: The Gradient Boosting Regressor was selected as the best-performing model based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Deployment: The trained model was saved and integrated into a Streamlit web application for easy use.
